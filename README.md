# **Bodygarage: The Minerals, Migraine, Sinusitis & Digestion Solution Book**

## **Background**

In 2009, my lifelong migraines worsened significantly, affecting both my sight and hearing. A CT scan revealed no physical issues, and my neurologist's solutions were limited to sleep-inducing medication. This experience prompted me to dedicate myself full-time to exploring alternative remedies.

Through this journey, I was exposed to diverse cultures, foods, and health perspectives, including Ayurveda and toxicology. I consumed numerous books, some rare or out-of-print, written by authors with specialized knowledge. From this extensive research, I identified shared principles that led to a new approach to health, which I integrated into my daily life. These changes resulted in significant health improvements, including the full restoration of my sight and hearing, and the end of the migraines I had suffered from since my teens.

## **Access the Final Editions of My Book**

This directory contains my book, self-published between 2013 and 2015 on Createspace/Amazon. It is available in five languages in PDF format. As of mid-2024, it is no longer being sold on any platform.

## **Languages and Translations**

I worked with several translators for the different language versions, and in some cases, multiple translators for the different editions. While I’ve made every effort to ensure accuracy, there may still be some minor typos and errors. Please forgive any issues; I did my best at the time, having only previously written and edited software user manuals.

## **Key Concepts and Insights**

The book reflects my experiences with both Eastern and Western approaches to food and nutrition, so some ideas and ingredients may be unfamiliar to readers, or even seem odd. However, there are valuable concepts here—like knowledge of commonly available clean nitrogenous proteins, which enrich and, in some cases, purify the body; knowledge of minerals in food and spices, with charts and references to guide simple nutrition experiments; grocery store fat experiments for cognitive gains; digestive rest for better well-being; and a natural and safe treatment for heavy metals blood toxicity using inexpensive grocery store ingredients—that, when explored, can possibly have a surprisingly positive impact on your overall health. I hope these ideas are received with curiosity and even a sense of adventure.

## **Outdated Content and Recommendations**

While the book offers valuable insights, some parts are outdated due to changes in product availability, and certain sections were tailored to my unique situation, which may not apply to all readers. I also want to advise that the heavy metals test kit noted in the book has had recent (2024) quality issues, so as a precaution, I strongly recommend consulting with your doctor and using a respected lab like the USA-based [Mosaic DX](https://mosaicdx.com). There is no affiliation between me and this company.

## **Content Overview and Benefits**

Although the **bodygarage.ca** website was shut down years ago and the book received little attention in terms of views and sales, I’m offering the content here to benefit readers seeking health improvement and to offer hope for better well-being. The included recipes and mineral charts are among the highlights of the book and should serve as useful tools for scientific meal planning. Refer to the bibliography and expansive index for more details on what the book really has to offer.

> **Note:** Some recommendations may require adaptation to your circumstances, and outdated content may not apply directly. Use discretion and always consult a healthcare professional before taking advice from any health-related book written by a non-professional like me. Your safety is the #1 priority.

## **Future Plans**

Since its last revision, I have faced new health challenges and gained more valuable insights over the past decade. These experiences could significantly enhance a future revision of this book.
