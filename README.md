# **Bodygarage: The Minerals, Migraine, Sinusitis & Digestion Solution Book**

## **Background**

In 2009, my lifelong migraines worsened significantly, affecting both my sight and hearing. A CT scan revealed no physical issues, and my neurologist's solutions were limited to sleep-inducing medication. This experience prompted me to dedicate myself full-time to exploring alternative remedies.

Through this journey, I was exposed to diverse cultures, foods, and health perspectives, including ayurveda and toxicology. I consumed numerous books, some rare or out-of-print, written by authors with specialized knowledge. From this extensive research, I identified shared principles that led to a new approach to health, which I integrated into my daily life. These changes resulted in significant health improvements.

## **Access the Final Editions of My Book**

This directory contains my book, self-published between 2013 and 2015 on Createspace/Amazon. It is available in five languages in PDF format. 

While the book offers valuable insights, some parts are outdated due to changes in product availability, and certain sections are tailored to my unique situation, which may not align with all readers. Although the **bodygarage.ca** website was shut down years ago and the book received little attention in terms of views and sales, Iâ€™m offering the content here to benefit everyone. The included recipes and mineral charts may still serve as useful tools for meal planning. Refer to the bibliography and index for more details on what the book has to offer.

> **Note:** Some recommendations may require adaptation to your circumstances, and outdated content may not apply directly. Use discretion and consult a healthcare professional if needed.

## Future Plans

Since its last revision, I have faced new health challenges and gained valuable insights over the past decade. These experiences could significantly enhance a future revision of this book.
